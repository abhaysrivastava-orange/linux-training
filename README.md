## üí° Optional Extension Ideas

You can later enhance this same base code to:
- Add **tools** (e.g., web search, calculator)
- Integrate with **retrieval or vector store**
- Maintain **conversation history**
- Add **custom prompt templates** or **guardrails**

Would you like me to enhance this sample to include **retrieval (PDF or document question answering)** or **tool use (like calculator + web search)** next?  
That would make your GitHub agent much more practical and impressive.
